# dynamic-pricing

In this repository, I take pricing concepts (static & dynamic) and apply them to publicly available Uber Rides data, which can be downloaded here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/dynamic-pricing-dataset?resource=download. This iteration solely uses numpy methods and is the initial exploration of the concept. A more sophisticated approach could be found in the main branch of this repository.

Walkthroughs of the models in use can be found under 'walkthroughs' folder.
