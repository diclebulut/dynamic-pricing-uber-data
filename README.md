# dynamic-pricing

In this repository, I take pricing concepts (static & dynamic) and apply them to publicly available Uber Rides data, which can be downloaded here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shuhengmo/uber-nyc-forhire-vehicles-trip-data-2021

Only January 2021 data, weather and taxi zone data was used to develop this pipeline, however, it could be applied to a larger dataset with input concatenation. 

Walkthroughs of the models in use can be found under 'walkthroughs' folder. 
Please visit the CLI guide and quick reference guide for running instructions. 
Please visit config.py file to make changes to main configuration components.
