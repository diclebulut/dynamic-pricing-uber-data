# dynamic-pricing

In this repository, I take pricing concepts (static & dynamic) and apply them to publicly available Uber Rides data, which can be downloaded here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/dynamic-pricing-dataset?resource=download 

Current Models (under development)
- Naive Static (single price)
- Gradient Descent
- Reinforcement Learning

Future Models
- Static Price Buckets
- Neural Networks
